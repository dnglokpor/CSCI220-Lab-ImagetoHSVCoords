# CSCI220-Lab-ImagetoHSVCoords
## Author: dnglokpor
## Date: 2020
## Description:
This project uses the **p5** library for Javascript to convert a normal 2D picture into a 3D rendering of it, using the brightness factor of each pixel as a depth coordinate. This allows for cool looking 3D pictures.
## How to use:
- run *npm install* to install dependencies.
- run *node server.js*
- navigate to *localhost:3000*
- Enjoy. The default picture is in the image folder but it an be easily replaced by any by changing the **load** method at line **24** of *client.js**.
